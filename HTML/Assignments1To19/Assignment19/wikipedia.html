                billion).
                This is a significant milestone, marking over a six-fold
                increase compared to the ₹8.26 trillion (US$98 billion)
                recorded in December 2013. <a

        <h3>List of Mutual fund companies/schemes bankrupted, defaulted or closed</h3>
        <h4>2020 Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund fiasco</h4>
        <p>In April 2020, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Templeton_Investments">Franklin Templeton</a>
            India unexpectedly
            wound up six credit funds with assets of close to
            $4 billion, citing a lack of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity_crisis">liquidity</a> amid the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic"> coronavirus pandemic</a>. These funds had large
            exposure
            to higher-yielding, lower-rated credit securities.
            The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities_and_Exchange_Board_of_India">Securities and Exchange
                Board of India (SEBI) </a>
            conducted a probe into this sudden closure and found
            “serious lapses and violations”. As a result, in June
            2021, SEBI barred Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund
            from launching any new debt schemes for two years.
            The regulator also ordered the fund house to refund
            investment and advisory fees, along with interest,
            of more than 5 billion rupees, and fined the global giant
            another 50 million rupees. <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_funds_in_India#cite_note-:debt1-15">[15][16][17][18]</a>
        </p>
        <p>Franklin Templeton said it strongly disagreed with the
            SEBI’s order and planned to appeal against it.
            The decision to wind up the schemes “was taken
            with the sole objective of preserving value for
            unitholders”, a spokesperson said. However, the
            closure of these funds sparked panic withdrawals
            from other Franklin Templeton schemes as well
            as credit funds of other asset managers, leading
            to a storm on social media and court cases by
            distraught investors. <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_funds_in_India#cite_note-:debt1-15">[18][15][17]</a></p>
        <h4>Reliance Mutual Fund</h4>
        <p>In 2019, the debt schemes of Reliance Mutual Fund
            faced a liquidity crisis due to their exposure
            to troubled companies like Dewan Housing Finance Corporation
            (DHFL). This led to severe redemptions and forced asset sales,
            which significantly affected investors. <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_funds_in_India#cite_note-19">[19][20]</a></p>
        <h4>IL&FS crisis and impact</h4>
        <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Leasing_%26_Financial_Services">IL&FS </a>crisis in
            2018 had
            a significant impact on the mutual fund industry,
            including those managed by IDBI Mutual Fund.
            The defaults by IL&FS led to a series of
            downgrades and defaults on its debt obligations
            and inter-corporate deposits1. This situation
            caused considerable distress in the financial
            markets and led to significant markdowns in the
            Net Asset Values (NAVs) of the affected mutual
            fund schemes, resulting in losses to investors. <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_funds_in_India#cite_note-22">[21][22][23]</a></p>
        <p>The defaults by Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) triggered a liquidity crisis, making it
            difficult for mutual funds to meet redemption demands without selling assets at distressed prices. This
            event heightened concerns about credit risk, leading to widespread downgrades of IL&FS and other non-banking
            financial companies (NBFCs). Consequently, the net asset values (NAVs) of mutual funds holding these
            securities were adversely affected, reflecting the increased credit risk and decreased market
            confidence. <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_funds_in_India#cite_note-auto7-26">[24][25][26][27]</a></p>
        <p>Investor confidence in debt mutual funds, particularly those with high exposure to NBFCs and infrastructure
            debt, was severely undermined. This led to significant outflows as investors moved towards safer and more
            liquid investment options. In response, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) introduced
            stricter regulations on sectoral exposure, single issuer limits, and the quality of collateral accepted in
            debt funds to enhance liquidity and reduce risks. Fund managers began focusing on higher-quality assets and
            improved risk management practices. The crisis underscored the need for better credit assessment and
            liquidity management, prompting regulatory reforms and a more cautious investment approach within the mutual
            fund industry <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_funds_in_India#cite_note-auto2-25">[24][25][26][27]</a></p>
        <h4>Amtek Auto Impact</h4>
        <p>Several mutual funds, including those managed by JP Morgan Asset Management India, faced significant issues
            due to exposure to Amtek Auto, which defaulted on its debt in 2015. JP Morgan had to suspend redemptions and
            impose exit loads to manage the liquidity crisis. <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_funds_in_India#cite_note-29">[28][29][30]</a></p>
        <h4>Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund (Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund)</h4>
        <p>In 2018, Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund faced redemption pressures in some of its debt schemes due to
            exposure to entities like the Essel Group companies. The Economic Times reported that the Aditya Birla Sun
            Life Mutual Fund was the biggest investor in the Essel Group, with an exposure of Rs 2,936 crore spread
            across 28 schemes1. This accounted for almost 37% of the total debt fund exposure to the Zee group, which is
            part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essel_Group">Essel Group.[31]</a></p>
        <h4>Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) crisis and impact</h4>
        <p>The Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) crisis had a profound impact on the Indian mutual fund industry.
            DHFL's defaults created a severe liquidity crunch, making it difficult for mutual funds to meet redemption
            pressures without selling assets at heavily discounted prices. This crisis raised significant concerns about
            the creditworthiness of housing finance companies (HFCs) and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs),
            leading to downgrades of DHFL's debt instruments and adversely affecting the net asset values (NAVs) of
            mutual funds holding these securities. <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_funds_in_India#cite_note-auto4-34">[32][33][34][35]</a></p>
        <p>Investor confidence in debt mutual funds, especially those with high exposure to HFCs and NBFCs, was severely
            shaken, resulting in substantial outflows as investors sought safer investments. In response, the Securities
            and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) increased scrutiny and introduced tighter regulations on mutual funds'
            exposure to individual issuers and sectors to mitigate such risks in the future. Fund managers adjusted
            their portfolios by shifting towards higher-quality and more liquid assets, reducing exposure to high-risk
            debt instruments. The crisis underscored the importance of credit quality and liquidity management,
            prompting regulatory reforms and a more cautious approach within the mutual fund industry. <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_funds_in_India#cite_note-auto15-33">[32][33][34][35]</a>
        </p>
        <h4>2001 UTI Mutual Fund (Unit Trust of India) fiasco</h4>
        <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTI_Asset_Management">Unit Trust of India</a> (UTI) faced a
            significant crisis in 2001, which was primarily due to large-scale
            redemption pressures and mismanagement, particularly in its flagship scheme, US-6412. The crisis was
            exacerbated by the Ketan Parekh scam, which caused a sharp decline in stock prices, leading to mutual funds,
            including UTI’s schemes, suffering severe consequences. <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_funds_in_India#cite_note-auto12-38">[36][37][38]</a></p>
        <p>The government intervened to protect investors and restructured UTI. This restructuring led to the
            bifurcation of UTI into two separate entities in 2003: the UTI Mutual Fund (now managed by the UTI Trustee
            Company Pvt. Ltd.) and the Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India (SUUTI), which took over the
            assets and liabilities of the erstwhile UTI12. The government’s intervention included a bailout package to
            stabilize the situation and ensure the protection of investors’ interests. <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_funds_in_India#cite_note-auto5-37">[36][37][38]</a></p>
        <h4>DHFL Pramerica Mutual Fund</h4>
        <p>Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited (DHFL) defaulted on its debt obligations in 2019. This event led to
            significant governance concerns and defaults by DHFL in meeting various payment obligations, prompting the
            Reserve Bank of India to supersede the Board of Directors of DHFL1. The default affected several mutual
            funds, including those managed by BNP Paribas Asset Management India Private Limited, which had to mark down
            the value of their investments in DHFL’s securities. <a

        <p>The crisis deepened with rating downgrades and write-offs by mutual funds, which had a cumulative exposure of
            ₹5,336 crore to securities issued by DHFL3. As a result, there was a severe liquidity issue and a drop in
            the Net Asset Values (NAVs) of the mutual funds, impacting investors’ returns. DHFL Pramerica Mutual Fund,
            which was a joint venture between DHFL and Pramerica Financial, Inc., also faced challenges due to the
            exposure to DHFL’s debt instruments. <a

        <h4>Yes Mutual Fund</h4>
        <p>In 2019, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_Bank">Yes Bank</a> faced severe financial stress and was
            eventually placed under a moratorium by the Reserve
            Bank of India (RBI) in March 2020. This led to significant challenges for Yes Mutual Fund, particularly its
            debt schemes that had exposure to Yes Bank’s securities. The crisis necessitated write-downs and affected
            investor confidence. Around 32 mutual fund schemes had exposure to Yes Bank’s downgraded debt papers, with a
            total exposure amounting to approximately ₹2,848 crore. The crisis led to write-downs of these securities
            and impacted the net asset values (NAVs) of the mutual funds involved, which in turn affected investor
            confidence. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_funds_in_India#cite_note-41">[41][42][43]</a></p>
        <h4>Kotak Mutual Fund</h4>
        <p>In 2019, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotak_Mutual_Fund">Kotak Mutual Fund</a> did face challenges
            with its Fixed Maturity Plans (FMPs) due to exposure to debt
            securities of companies like the Essel Group. The fund house was unable to redeem investments from these
            companies, which led to delays and partial rollovers of the FMPs. This situation affected the investors’
            expected returns. Consequently, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) barred Kotak from
            launching new FMPs for six months and imposed a fine for failing to abide by regulatory requirements. <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_funds_in_India#cite_note-44">[44]</a>
        </p>
        <h4>HDFC Mutual Fund</h4>
        <p>HDFC Mutual Fund did face a situation in 2018-2019 due to its exposure to companies like <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essel_Group">Essel Group</a> and
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Leasing_%26_Financial_Services">IL&FS</a>. The credit
            events involving these companies led to significant mark-downs in the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Asset_Values">Net Asset Values</a>
            (NAVs) of some of HDFC Mutual Fund’s debt schemes. This situation resulted in investor concerns and
            redemption pressures. <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_funds_in_India#cite_note-auto10-45">[45][46]</a>
        </p>
        <p>To elaborate, the IL&FS crisis was one of the biggest <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis">financial crises in India</a>, with the company
            defaulting
            on several of its obligations due to a cash shortfall. The debt involved was about Rs 1 lakh crore.
            Similarly, Essel Group companies were grappling with debt woes, which put mutual funds, including HDFC,
            under redemption pressure. However, HDFC Mutual Fund later recovered the entire investment made in the
            non-convertible debentures issued by Essel Group companies. <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_funds_in_India#cite_note-auto-46">[45][46]</a></p>
        <h4>Sahara Mutual Fund</h4>
        <p>SEBI conducted an examination to determine whether Sahara Mutual Fund, its Asset Management Company, and its
            trustees were ‘fit and proper’ as per regulatory standards. This was in light of a previous SEBI order from
            2011 concerning two other Sahara entities, which were directed to refund money collected through Optionally
            Fully Convertible Debentures (OFCDs) to investors. <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_funds_in_India#cite_note-47">[47][48]</a></p>
        <p>In 2015, SEBI ordered the winding up of Sahara Mutual Fund’s schemes due to non-compliance with regulatory
            requirements. The regulatory scrutiny and legal challenges indeed led to operational difficulties and
            affected investor confidence in the fund house. <a
